### Method 
Stable Diffusion Inpainting is a latent text-to-image diffusion model capable of generating photo-realistic images given any text input, with the extra capability of inpainting the pictures by using a mask.

Thus, in the background generation Stable Diffusion Image Inpainting task implemented as inference.

For the sake of background removal, Highly Accurate Dichotomous Image Segmentation ( ECCV 2022) papers implemented as the inference.
